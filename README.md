CraftBukkit Init Script
====

This init script launches and controls CraftBukkit in the background with the help of GNU screen. The original version of this script has been released to the public domain under http://pastebin.com/tQBm2xWv . I only take credit for the changes I made myself.

Documentation is provided within the script itself.
